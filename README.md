# Fresh WP Install with 'BOOTSTRAP 4, SASS, ES6/BABEL, ACF, CPTUI


Ready to go Wordpress installation including Understrap (starter theme), Bootstrap, Sass, ES6 file linked to Babel, Gulp, Advanced Custom Fields, Custom Post Type UI.

Understrap default 'custom-js.js' does not work with Uglify when writing ES6 Syntax. This is a quick setup to begin writing the latest Vanilla JavaScript syntax such as fat arrow functions`()=>{}`, Promises (async/await), let / const variables, array methods (map, filter, reduce), rest operators and much more.

#Clone Directory

#Install Worpress

cd to `/wp-content` directory  

Type `gulp watch`  

Write your JS to `src/js/es6.js`  

Write your Sass to `sass/theme.scss`  

Make a cool theme :)
