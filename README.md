# Fresh WP Install with 'BOOTSTRAP 4, SASS, ES6/BABEL, ACF, CPTUI


Ready to go Wordpress installation including Understrap (starter theme), Bootstrap, Sass, ES6 file linked to Babel, Gulp, Advanced Custom Fields, Custom Post Type UI.

Understrap default 'custom js file' does not work with Uglify, causing errors when writing ES6 Syntax. This is setup to begin writing the latest Vanilla JavaScript syntax for such features as fat arrow functions`()=>{}`, Promises (async/await), let / const variables, array methods (map, filter, reduce), rest operators and much more.

Simply cd to wp-content directory, >>gulp watch
Write your JS to src/js/es6.js

Make a cool theme :)
